# Description
##### Project Aim and Description:
A software for families to help track accomplishments, coordinate chores, establish financial overviews and more.

##### Basic Features Planned:
- Accomplishment Tracking
Unlike Todo lists and tasks that tend to mostly not get done, accomplishments focus on things that you did do, allowing you to see at the end of the day that your not-so-productive-day was actually more productive than expected. Basically, a success journal that you can also share with your family, if they thought you were just being lazy all day.
- Financial Transactions Import and Overview
All families have financial management, ideally. We’d like provide the possibility to import bank transactions and customize the categories of each transaction, so that insight can be gained into where the money was spent. These category customizations will be remembered, so that future imports can be processed much faster.
- Reports
Most of the above functionality will contain reports that give visual feedback, be it a history of accomplishments per day, unfinished chores or a pie chart of the financial transaction categories, we want people to be able to see their data in an actionable way.
- Calendar Planner
- Messaging (E.g.: chats/walls) and comments

##### Advanced Features & Outlook:
- Chores
Some everyday things, like taking out the trash, are unavoidable. Accomplishments can be linked to chores and expected chores can be specified with custom frequencies or intervals.
- Notifications customization
Especially useful for parents, you can choose to receive notifications about accomplishments of others, or of expected chores.
- Accomplishment reward system
- Transaction logging and reconciliation with bank statements
- Multi-platform (E.g.: Cellphone/Desktop app)
- More can be added eventually...
